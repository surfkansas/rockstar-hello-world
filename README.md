# Rockstar "Hello World"
This is a simple "hello world" application written in Rockstar. Just so that I can say I'm a Rockstar developer.

This extremely nihilistic code can be run by any Rockstar interpretter. I would recommend using the online interpretter, located at the following address:

https://codewithrockstar.com/online

To execute, copy the text from `hello.rock` into the code block and click the ***Rock!*** button. The code should execute giving the expected "Hello World" response.

I based my logic on analyzing Dylan Beattie's example code, available here: https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar/blob/main/examples/hello-world.rock

If you read both versions, you should be able to see some strong similarities. (Honestly, how many ways can one write Hello World anyway?) As with the best of music history, I hope my work both stands on its own while being reverent and respectful of the rock that came before.
